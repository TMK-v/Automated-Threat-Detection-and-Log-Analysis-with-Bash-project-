# Automated-Threat-Detection-and-Log-Analysis-with-Bash-project

This project is a part of my cybersecurity portfolio, showcasing the use of Bash scripting to automate the detection of suspicious login activity through system log analysis.

The script suite parses authentication logs, geolocates suspicious IP addresses using a public API, applies filtering based on whitelists/blacklists, and generates reports. The system can optionally block malicious IPs using iptables.

This project is intended for demonstration and educational purposes.

You must adapt file paths, permissions, and environment settings to suit your own Linux system (e.g., auth.log location may vary by distribution).

The IP addresses used are example entries for testing functionality and do not represent actual threats.
